# Deepfence ThreatStryker

Modern applications are highly distributed and dynamic, often running as containerized microservices in public, hybrid or multi cloud deployments. Deepfence ThreatStryker observes and secures these applications:

1. Inspecting the production platforms, looking for potential vulnerabilities, exposed secrets and compliance exceptions
1. Observing network traffic ‘indicators of attack’ and on-host/in-container ‘indicators of compromise’
1. Identifying the presence of attack behavior and neutralizing attacks before they result in compromise of your applications

This documentation explains the process of deploying and operating the ThreatStryker security observability platform, using either Deepfence Cloud or by installing directly.
